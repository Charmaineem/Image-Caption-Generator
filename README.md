# Image-Caption-Generator
In this project I created an image caption generator with object detection. It is focused on captioning images containing humans, cats and/or dogs with a user interface created using Gradio.

Models used:
1.DETR (End-to-End Object Detection) model with ResNet-50 backbone for object detection
2.BLIP: Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training for Unified Vision-Language Understanding and generation for image captioning
